<h3 align="center">About</h3>

<p align="center">
Focused on bioinformatically deriving biomedical-relevant answers from public data in the population health field. 
I find some purpose in helping and mentoring others. Broadly, I aim to eloquently teaching topics that are esoteric and under-taught.
